There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Murmillo is a real-time competition-based programming platform where users can compete with one another on various coding challenges. Using Murmillo makes learning more collaborative, competitive, and fun!
 
## Sub-Heading ##
  > Murmillo is for programmers for all levels. Users can select problem types, difficulty levels, and number of players in coding challenges.
 
## Summary ##
  > Learning programming is an arduous task, especially if you are doing it by yourself.  Murmillo brings excitement and collaboration to the learning experience by creating a space where programmers can compete and learn from one another.
 
## Problem ##
  > On many coding challenge platforms, users are simply given problems to solve with little guidance and support from the community. These sites often do not provide users any insights on their performance.
 
## Solution ##
  > Murmillo facilitates collaborative learning by providing a space where users can compete on coding challenges and learn from one another.  Users can communicate with other users in chat rooms before and after coding competitions, and we encourage sharing of knowledge and technique. Murmillo also keeps a track of all competitions, and users can visualize their performance metrics.
 
## Quote from You ##
  > We believe that learning is ineffective unless it's exciting and fun.  Murmillo is a collaborative space where users can improve their technical skills and learn how to solve problems quickly.  
 
## How to Get Started ##
  > Getting started is super easy.  All you need is a GitHub account to register for our services. You can start competing in minutes.
 
## Customer Quote ##
  > From User A: "Solving coding challenges under pressure was exactly the preparation I needed for my programming job interview. Murmillo will not only improve your programming skills, but also your ability to solve problems quickly!"
 
  > From User B: " Murmillo enabled me to see how I stack against other coders, a metric many other sites are missing. Plus it's super fun working on competitive coding challenges with other people."
